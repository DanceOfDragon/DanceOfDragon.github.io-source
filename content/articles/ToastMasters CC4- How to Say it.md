### The Script

Many years later, as I face the shimmering flame at a fireplace, I will definitely recall that distant winter afternoon, when an old man read to a few boys.That moment freezes, penetrates time and reaches out to the deepest part of my mind.  About 10 years ago, back in my hometown, every one or two weeks, I would take about 2hrâ€™ coach back and forth between my home and my secondary school. Until now, when I closed eyes, the meandering road is like long-exposure photo of free-moving glow stick in the dark. It is so random yet it is also so distinctly clear.It was in late January, can be chilly cold in my hometown.  A few friends proposed a crazy idea to me: walk back home. They said they knew some shortcuts. I joined them. Why not?We packed our stuff, homework and books mostly, and set out. It was a delight for me so I forgot how heavy those books were. My reddened ears perfectly reflected how warm I felt inside.   The naked winter trees lined along the road, frosted leaves lied in the pathway through the forest. As we walked further, the altitude became higher, the temperature became lower, the wind howled through desolate mountains, snowflakes whirled in the bitter air. <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108107823@N04/36229788342/in/dateposted-public/" title="CC4-how to say it2"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4333/36229788342_5bef549a3e.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="CC4-how to say it2"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
 Our enthusiasm was gradually taken over by tiredness. Thought about how far we were still from home; the bleak grey cloud overhead now was over our mind. We did not talk, we walked, walked and walked.Three hours later, we reached a small lonely grocery store on a mountainside. A few groceries scattered in an even smaller shelf against the corner. An old man was sitting near a stove, holding a timeworn book in one of his hands, with another hand moving slowly along the lines as he read. A pair of glasses rode on his small red nose. It looked like they were goanna fall in any minute we broken into the tranquility.There were a few chairs circling around the stove, we just sit in quietly. The old man raised up his head, gave us a short gaze. We were so much ready to receive his greeetings, with a little bit sympathy hopefully, but no, he put down his book on chair, added some more wood into the stove. Grey threads of smoke came out of it, hung up like ragged ribbons, smelled like the odour of the almond. Then he picked up the lines where he stopped and continued his reading. Left only the sound of wood-burning, the wind-blowing. The flame casted soft golden light on his wrinkled face, feels like an oil painting. His hands were much like the old naked winter trees, only when they move you could tell they were actually alive. His voice, slow, fluctuating, ups and downs, sounded like coming from 600 years ago, when those storytellers were talking vividly about famous characters in Chinese history.

In the center, just an old man reading to a few boys, or rather reading to himself, at a fireplace.
