Beside my daily focus on experiments, papers and research-relates courses, I have recently joined two activities which I planned to do quite some time ago. 

1.) participating 10Km race (in a team of 4) in SunDown Marathon Singapre. Until now, after one month of training, I have accumulated 100Km's run. The race is on 28May2016. 
 
2.) attending a nearby Toastmasters Club, where I have finished two competent communicator(CC) projects. Go with the schedule, I shall finish CC projects within this year.

The following manuscript from my CC2 speech gives some idea about my running experiences. 

*****

Hello, fellow toastmasters and guests, good afternoon! Before I start my own story, could I have a show of hand: anyone here is running or jogging regularly? (If yes) Great! I hope I could have some resonance with you about what I am going to talk about. 

> comments: how about those people what do not run? try to engage with them as well.]I have been a regular runner for 5 years. Only just yesterday I finished my first 12km, so far the longest distance I have tried, with quite some effort. As a “regular runner”, how come it took five years to reach this? Here today I am going to share some of my running experiences, including how did I start running, what did I get out of this exercise, where did I get stuck and how did I try to improve. 

> commments: since start, impose my own standards onto the audience, creating invisible pressure/ uncomfortable flavor.First thing first:  I started running since I came here. The reason I chose running is simple, I need to keep myself fit, and running is probably one of the easiest sports I can do anywhere  anytime. I can run alone or run in groups; plus, the weather here is really suitable for running throughout the year. Unlike some serious runners, I did do any research, did not buy any special shoes or clothes, I did not set any goal, I just went out and ran, two/ three / four times a week. That's how impetuous I was. That was how I started running. 

> comments: indeed explained how did I start running as outlined, no drama, no struggle.Once get started, the next step is to maintain it. Luckily, running seems a natural fit for me, so it is not that difficult for me to keep it going. I may stop running sometime, but every now and then, I still feel the urge, coming from my body, to go out and run. Over these years, I enjoyed running as much as the benefits of running. Running wise, the most enjoyable moment is probably the time when I feel like I am meditating, forgot I am actually running, forgot the pain, forgot the time. I had this kind of Zen experience but not so often. As for the benefits of running, it helped me to get sleep, helped me to manage pressure, so I rarely got sick over the years. Meanwhile, through running, I have set my feet on almost every possible road near school. The small area around NUS became even smaller from a runners' perspective. Maybe that is why people say, when your speed reaches another level, you view the same thing different. No, no, I am not talking about relativity or time travel.> comments: some people in the audience did lauge over my little joke, rather sutle joke, which I used again in next section. But need to make it more elaborate, leave more time for the audience to digest.
Talking about speed, you see until now I barely mentioned how far I run and how fast I run.  The irony is, I am not only a regular runner, I used to be a regular-5km –casual-runner. I started out by running 5km, no more no less, and maintained there for almost 5 years. I tried once in while to reach higher speed, or longer distance, beyond 5km, heart seemed like to explode, could not maintain a rhythmic breath, need to rest halfway, just like when I initially started running. So eventually, I fall back to my comfortable 5km zone.   That is like my 'plateau, I lie there, comfortably.  Only recently, after I signed up for a 10km race, I started to pay serious attention to the metrics. For example, the average speed, the proper running frequency, the lactate threshold, the aerobic base, and so on. Moreover, I started to care about what kind of shoes I should wear, started to trying out different Apps, started to reading books about training programme. As I mentioned in the start, I just finished my first 12km run yesterday and completed 100km after one month of training. Yeah! I can feel the changes, clearly. One simple change is that I can maintain at a relatively high speed for 5 or 6km which I could not do before. Finally, I broke out from that 5km plateau and reach another level. Though haven't got any time travel experience yet...> comments: the changes I felt are real. This is what discipline and deliberation brings to us. But do the audience feel the same way as I do? I doubt. The plot I did was not creating such a context and atmosphere. To summaries:  it is simple, I started running; It is enjoyable and it brings benefits to my health and my work, I maintained my running habits over the last 5 years; it is challenging and equally interesting to get more metric and more scientific, I break out from the 5km plateau comfort zone. The lesson I learned from this experience is: We all know some common senses like "do small things in a great way", "accumulation of quantitative changes leads to qualitative transformation", however, only when we really start doing it, keep working on it, constantly improving it, we will have the chance to feel the transformation. And for that, it is a long way to go, and I am on my way.
> comments: too many words and too much information yet too little cathy points. Try to subtract.
