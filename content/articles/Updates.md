How time flies!

It has been over one year since my last post. Pelican, Python and all their dependencies, on which this blog has built, have been updated to their current versions. Indeed, not to advance is to fall behind.

Updated the software and fixed the bugs. Meanwhile, a few updates of my activities.

### Research

**Two journal papers, Three conferences**

Research is my primary focus. There’s a lot to say about it, the pain, the gain, the breakthrough, the stagnation, the struggle, the lost, the anxiety. Good or bad, it generally suits my life style.

As of now, co-authored two journal papers, one is with my <span class="caps">FYP</span> mentor(_Bioengineering and Biotechnology_), and the other is with my colleague (_Nature Communications_). Interestingly, in both papers I was responsible for the computational simulations.

Meanwhile, my research results were sent to a few local conferences(<span class="caps">BES</span>, <span class="caps">SAMES</span>, Optofluidics) and one overseas (microTAS2017). Overall the idea and results are well accepted.

Research is a highly competitive and rapidly changing field. I need to grasp that feeling of staying on the edge, staying ahead.

### Running

**Two half-marathon**

Last year on December 11, I went alone to Batam Island (Indonesia) to participate the very first Barelang Bridge Marathon. Though my right knee was seriously injured midway, managed to drag myself to the end in 2hours 18min. Met a new friend, a local Indonesian Chinese, who finished in 1hr 47mins. Sometimes I do get more by going through a journey alone.

This year on March 25, with a few friends, I participated the <span class="caps">SUNDOWN</span> Marathon again. Previously I did 10Km in 51min. This time I finished half-marathon in 2hr 5mins. I hated the upward bridge near the finishing line.

Meanwhile, I have signed up for a full marathon scheduled on December 3, 2017\. Recently I have become more conscious of the metrics such as heart rate, pace, etc. by following the Nike+ Running Club. Though running for speed has never been my top priority, it is helpful in strengthening my discipline.

### Toastmasters

**<span class="caps">CC</span>, Club President**

By this May 2017, one year after I joined the Toastmasters Club, I completed my Competent Communicator project. About my speech quality, one senior member and my mentor said, “your speeches are full of substance”, yet I understand the underlying message is that I still need much more learning and practice in delivery.

Now the brand-new programme called <span class="caps">PATHWAYS</span> has been rolled out in <span class="caps">SG</span>. I decided to embrace the new one and start it again from Ice Breaker:)

Apart from the speaking/leadership training, there are many other good stuff coming out of this team. People are positive, sincere and inspirational. People from diverse backgrounds provide different perspectives.

Quite reluctantly initially but fearless in the end, I decide to take the position of Club President for the coming term. It will be challenging and it will be fun. I need to take a giant stride to make some changes, just as what I did during my very first swimming and diving this year.

### Other Activities

**Reading, Writing, Investing**

Undisciplined curiosity kills me. I do not know who said this, life without art is unbearable. Reading, or the content, to me is the thing that makes life less unbearable, or more interesting. Last year(2016), I read 20+ books, including novels, biography, Scientifics, religions, sociology etc. This year (2017), my readings are focusing on three areas: investment, science, and Russian/the Soviet Union literatures. If there is one discipline is choosing which book to read, it would be that I only read great books by great authors.

Often I find myself in a situation where I am hungry to take but lazy to deliver. Terence Tao gives his blog the title ::**What’s New**:: [https://terrytao.wordpress.com](https://terrytao.wordpress.com). Feynman Richard said that ::_What I cannot create I do not understand_::. Delivery is important, both in its substance and its form. To this end, I have started writing consistently on Quora [https://www.quora.com](https://www.quora.com). In terms of vocabulary and delivery in creative writing, the gap is more obvious than ever when I have to write down a few sentences by myself.

Another area I have spent a bit time is investing, mainly in funds and common stocks. Since I withdrew from my [previous adventure](http://linnus.net/posts/2015/Oct/13/personal%20finance%20management%20and%20related/) in China stock market, I have put my trading account rest for more than two years! This year, influenced by a friend, I jumped back into this game. Luckily, the market I ventured in this time (<span class="caps">HKEX</span>）is in its Bull stage. I will see how far this bull market can go and how is my investment outcome.
