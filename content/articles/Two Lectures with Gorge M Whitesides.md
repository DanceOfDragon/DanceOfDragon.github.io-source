When I was (and still am) reading extensively about my research topic,  papers from Prof. Whitesides' group always caught my eyes. My project spans from electrochemistry, surface chemistry and microfluidics, it was thrillingly devastating to find out that they actually have pioneered these areas and explored to a great depth. Lucky to get the rare chance to hear what a man at his height would think about research in general and research in this field.


Recently He gave two public lectures while on this 2-day visit in Singapore, one was about his thoughts about chemistry research and the other was about one technique developed in his lab (i.e. Self-Assembled-Monolayer SAM). The latter is closely related to what I am working on. Something looks like this:

Vitalized by Prof Whitesides' humor and in-depth knowledge, both lectures were interesting and insightful. What I cherished most is his way of thinking and his strategy to approach a topic. It inspired me to note down in this post.

The 1st lecture was titled as **Reinventing Chemistry**. The title looks a bit misleading at first glance, even after listening to his speech. After I checked their new programme *Origin of Life*, I realized that they are really ambitious in addressing the fundamental unknowns yet with the big/urgent practical issues (global warming, food,healthcare) in mind. The lecture itself trys to cover many topics on many levels but only slightly. He was not offering answers but observations and opinions. 

For example, speaking of the development of chemistry, he said *after WWII until 2000, chemistry was about molecules (DNA, protein etc.) and now it was about everything involving molecules*. From what I understand, he meant that our understanding of the particles (thereafter molecules), thanks to the breakthrough in physics,  have reached a level  where we need to use the knownledge to address real issues. Just like there's few real  discoveries in physics since the establishment of a few fundamental theories ( Relativity and Quantum physics ), chemistry is now basically expanding with old techs rather than digging. Followed by his endevour in fusing chemistry and chemical engineering, and also considering lots of engineering works done by his lab, I believe this is logic behind his saying.  

Talking about dynamic relationship between *government*,*industry* and *university*, he thinks that the convential model is gone or not applicable any more. Industries have doubts in the 'paper producers' while universities are chasing to lead the frontiers, creating a wider gap between the two. A recently [comment on Sicence](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/336/336ed5)from industry and [its rebuttal from Nature](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v34/n6/full/nbt.3619.html) from academia are worthy reading. 

To address this problem, Prof Whitesides threw a few ideas researchers can think about: i.) product model; ii.) business model; iii.) market model. Now we researchers shall think like a business as well, if I understands his words correctly. Meanwhile, he encourages young researchers to learn some vocabs in finance, business etc. An interesting quote from him: *money is the common currency, the translational channel between people from different professionals*.  Interesting! Think about the stacks of his patants and think abut the PDMS the labs are using. Saddly, many, if not most, of the research groups fall into the trap of the never-ending cycle: publish papers, get funding, publish more papers. We work long hour in the lab, near the blench, but every now and then, we need to raise our heads and talk to poeple, establish some kind of connection with the real world. 

![Risk, Failure](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/BlogImages/failure.jpg)
Talking about risks in exploring new territories, he gave a very elaborate 2X2 (3X3 is too complex), showing that taking the risk is always better than not no matter failure or success. This is of course very true in academics. Quote from him, *if you start a new field, everyone else working on it actually is working for you, for free.* Cannot be more true, I am probably one of them working for him too ><. Hopefully one day could get recognized in someway (paper><?). 

It is easy to say, but everyone with some research experience will probably lauge over it and then continue working on his or her own small little incremental project. It is not because we do not want to take the risk and dig the next big discovery. It is HARD. 


Finally, talking about the problems we are working on, he said we should always work on the problems that matter. Think about the tons of papers published, many papers are just trying to answer the question raised up under no ground. Quite a few papers from his group demonstrated that they did have this strategy in mind, for example, paper microfluidic based biosensors combining with cheap phones for healthcare etc. 

In his 2nd lecture, he shared their recent paper in studying SAM (in collaboration with a NUS group). The interesting thing is that I never thought about this technique could somehow help (potentially) address the issues in semiconductor industry (slowdown of Moore's Law). I just directly use the technique in my project, but after listening to their work, I realized that I am actually using a technique that is not well understood. This is the time I need to restate my view on this, leave the basics to the scientist, I shall engineer things. Of course, the limitations of the techniques are noted.

Overall, Prof Whitesides is thinking of the (chemistry) research business at another level. As young researcher in whatever lab with limited resources, it is reasonable to get practical to get the job done, but it is important to appreicate and install this kind of mentablity so as to move further and hgiher.
