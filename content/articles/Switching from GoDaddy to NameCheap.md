One year. 

My little blog regiested with GoDaddy and hosted on Github is one year old. 

Time is a bitch, truly. 

Godday is too. 

Decoy me into its green world and demand for 24+ bucks for renewal, declining every Promo Code I tried. Condemn. 


There I am. 

Switching to NameCheap, with the help of NameCheap's super clear instructions. 

Much better user experience from overall UI designa and Dashboard navigation. 

GoDaddy, Go. 

End.
