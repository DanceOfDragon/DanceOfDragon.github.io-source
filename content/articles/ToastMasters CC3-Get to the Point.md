### The Script

Hello, fellow toastmasters, good afternoon!In my last speech, I shared some of my experiences in running and told you about my training for first quarter marathon. Today, I am glad to tell you that we did it! Out of 214 teams, we ranked No.6. I finished it around 51mins, our team average is 56mins.  It seems my training paid off. > comment: related back to my previous speech. 
I still remember during the last 500m when I was running, I looked at my phone and felt that there's still some hope to finish within 50min, which is what I aimed for. So I wanted to seize the final chance and gather my energy , hope to speed up. You can imagine what I got, a strong feeling of soreness, and even my heart was pumping devastatingly, the speed just hang there. For those who run, you may know how it felt; even you don't run, I believe once in while you will feel it when you run after a bus.This feeling of soreness is related to one thing: Lactate.  Today my CC topic is get to the point, Finally I get to the point.  I will introduce you a simple model to train your lactate threshold. > comment: The preceeding is a bit too long. 
First thing first, what is lactate and what is lactate threshold?To correct a common misconception, even at resting conditions, we produce lactate as well. We do not feel the soreness. It is because it gets cleared rapidly from the muscle into the blood.  In intensity exercise (anaerobic condition), However our muscle cannot clear the lactate fast enough , it will accumulate in the muscle in the form lactic acid and cause this soreness feeling.Â It is basically a self-protection mechanism, which asked to stop to avoid over-exercising, causing any damage to your muscle. Though everyone will produce lactate, will accumulate lactate in sufficiently intense activity, there's one key difference. Different people will start accumulate lactate at different level of intensity. The maximum steady state effort that can be maintained for a period of time without continuous lactate increasing is called Lactate threshold. [show picture].  It is commonly used in the training of endurance sports such as running / swimming. So now in endurance sports, we do not want to feel sore, we do not want to stop or slow down. We want to continue to use aerobic method, which is more energy efficient; also we want to maintain at relatively high speed. The answer is to train your lactate threshold, and it is trainable. Here is a simple model, two important parameters will affect the lactate threshold.

Meanwhile, your heat muscle should be strong enough to provide enough oxygen. Essentially, it is to build the solid and strong infrastructure (pumps) which can provide stronger force. Second, increase the economy of movement. Here economy means you can do the same thing with less energy. It is mixture of many factors, such as weight, fat, physiology, anatomy, even your shoes and clothes. Essentially, it is to reduce the friction. So, with this two, through increase VO2, you increase your force in single stroke; and also reduce friction, as a result, our LT will shift, and we can maintain at aerobic method at higher speed.
