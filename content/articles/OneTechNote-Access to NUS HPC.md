Every now and then, I need to use *ANSYS Workbench(Fluent)* for fluid dynamics simulation. NUS's HPC(High Performance Computing)service offers a range of modelling and simulation [software](https://comcen.nus.edu.sg/services/hpc/application-software/) including *Fluent*. Numerical simulations usually require a large amount of computation power, and the service is meant to handle this (though I do not really feel the so-called high performance). They have limited licence. First come and first serve.  More information could be found [here](https://comcen.nus.edu.sg/services/hpc/getting-started/introductory-guide-for-new-hpc-users/).The problem I have with the HPC is that their user interface is somewhat terrible, at least from the perspective of a Mac non-CS user. ~~No clear guide is provided to Mac(i.e. Unix) users either~~. [There is one actually](https://comcen.nus.edu.sg/technus/hpc/accessing-hpc-resources-via-a-mac/). Therefore, after some searching and crawling, here I present a clean and easy way to access NUS HPC and manage files, specifically for Mac users with no command-line experience. **Step 1:Register an Account with Computer Centre**Get through the first door [here](https://comcen.nus.edu.sg/services/hpc/getting-started/register-for-hpc/). You need to explain your purpose, your preferred software (Fluent, MATLAB, etc.) **Step 2:Establish Connection with HPC**1::  Mozilla Firefox In Firefox Browser, key in the address <https://bobcat.nus.edu.sg>. It will ask you to install the items listed in the 2nd point. 2:: Java and Oracle Secure Global Desktop Client- Make sure install the latest version from office website. Java control panel could be located at *Preferences*,as shown below: ![Java-control-panel](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/BlogImages/java-preference.png)- Enter the control panel, under *security*, add the following two address to the trusted list.![Java-Exception-Site-List](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/BlogImages/java-security.png)- Under *advanced* menu, check the item using "Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)"![Java-TLS](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/BlogImages/java-TLS.png)3:: XQuartz It is an open-source replacement of previous X11, which is windowing system (GUI) for apps that were written to work in X-Windows. Download the latest here from [XQuartz](http://www.xquartz.org).Now, everything you need in order to run the Software housing in HPC cluster is in place. You can either click the icon of *Oracle Secure Global Desktop Client* or type the address <https://bobcat.nus.edu.sg> in Firefox, both will get to this page: ![login page](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/BlogImages/login.png)After login, a window will pop up for your confirmation: ![pop-run](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/BlogImages/java-run.png).A workspace will appear: ![workspace](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/BlogImages/workspace-hpc.png)The *MobileVisLab* and *HighEndVisLab* are for graphics-intensive application, for which you may find useful to instll another view software [TurbVNC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/latest/download). I personally do not feel the speed difference. **Step 3: Upload/Download Files**Here comes the important part. Since within the software (say Fluent), I could not directly import files from my local disk or write files to my local disk, a file transferring system is essential. As a side note, recently NUS HPC has allocated a new working directory (/hpctmp2) which offers 500GB space. But files older than 60 days will be purged away,so be carefully, do not back up files there.![working directory](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/BlogImages/HPC-directory.png)Meanwhile, I found the [HDrive](https://comcen.nus.edu.sg/services/online_storage/nus-hdrive-personal-network-drive/) has been decommissioned. I used to used it to store simulation files and even school works because I can access from any PC on campus.I am using [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/?l=en)(free) to access not only NUS HPC but all other servers(e.g.my blog, my lab and other public servers.)  Setup of the connection is very simple:![CyberDuck-Setup](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/BlogImages/cyberduck-setup.png)Note: `<nickname>` for your ease of reference of the server (for NUS-HPC); `<account>`: your account registered with HPC, usually it is NUSNET NO. `<hostname>` could be from any one of the following: ![HPC-Hostname](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/BlogImages/hpc-hostname.png). Once connection established, viewing the files, uploading, and downloading files just follow.  **Step 4: Play and Enjoy**If any problem, people at computer centre are really helpful. Please approach them. **One More Step: Command Line**Truth be told, I do find *command line tool* works faster and more elegant. Here it is: Find the APP **Terminal** and key in the following single line command: `ssh â€“X <account>@<hpc_server>`Again, `<account>` refers to your NUSNET account, `<hpc-server>` refers to any one of the hostname shown above. Then just follow the question, say *yes*, input *password*, and type the software you want to use( for each specific software, refer the HPC website). Of course, Java and XQuartz are still required.  **Some More Resources**: 1.
