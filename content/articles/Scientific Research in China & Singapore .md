Upon its release, it soon became headlines throughout many science communities and presses (e.g. *知识分子*） Here as a junior student, though outside mainland China, on my road to scientific research, I have been watching the changing landscape of R&D environment. Meanwhile, I did a bit more (superficial) research about Singapore's scientific research environment as well. First take a look at the landscape of R&D investment across the globe. ![R&D / GDP - data from world bank](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/ipython%20notebook/MAP%20R%26D.png)The following picture summaries what the whole report is trying to addressing based on extensive quantitative and qualitative data gathered from Chinese researchers themselves (~1700 researchers who have publications in NPG): ![summary](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/ipython%20notebook/npg-summary%20table.png)## Highlights A few issues are highlighted under each section. in **funding science**> - China should devote more funding to basic research.> > - China’s funding system has already made some significant progress towards a more rigorously meritocratic assessment approach. in **doing science**> - Insufficient training /support for junior scientists;> - Reduce the administrative workload of senior scientists;> - There are two major gaps in its workforce — a lack of lab technicians and post-doctoral fellows.> in **sharing science**> - Better training in scientific writing for researchers would address the disadvantage in writing papers and communicating research findings in English. > - There is also a clear need for institutes to offer incentives for researchers who talk about their work with the public and industry.### Some Facts: > - 1331B RMB on R&D in 2014, second to USA;> - 2450000 SCI papers in 2014, second in the world;> - 928000 patents in 2014, NO.1 the 4th consecutive year;> - lag behind the world average in many subjects in normalized citation impact;> - researcher mobility changes from brain drain to brain gain (haigui 海归）.  ![researcher mobility](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/ipython%20notebook/npg-mobility.png)> - Although many of the PhDs and postdocs surveyed by NPG still plan to go abroad for a period, the vast majority indicated that they plan to return to China within  five years (![npg-mobility](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/ipython%20notebook/npg-mobility2.png)> > - more foreign universities are opening campus or research centers in China jointly with local universities; > > - main research funding programmes > ![npg-funding programms](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/ipython%20notebook/npg-funding%20programms.png)> > - A larger proportion of home-grown scientists felt that they received insufficient mentoring during their progression from PhD to postdoc to independent researcher.![insufficient mentoring](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/ipython%20notebook/npg-mentoring.png)> > - Most Chinese scientists lack training in laboratory, data and research project management, while improved quality is needed for training in scientific writing and publishing.> ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/ipython%20notebook/npg-training.png)> - Chinese scientists identified the lack of postdocs and technicians as the biggest hurdle for their research teams.> ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/ipython%20notebook/npg-posdoctechnician.png)> > - Chinese researchers reported being assessed primarily by quantitative metrics. ![quantitative assessment](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/ipython%20notebook/npg-metric%20assessment.png)## Suggestions###Funding Science- Drive profound innovation by funding more basic research. (5% compared with USA's 18%, UK's 16% and Japan's 12%). - Continue investment in ‘blue sky’ ideas that will generate long-term rewards. - Invest more in younger scientists. (1,000 Talent Plan, 973 programme) - Increase funding allowances for human resource to transform research efficiency. - Funding bodies can create an environment of transparency with more merit-based peer review (instead of through personal/professional connections). - Funders can help scientists to be more productive and efficient by minimizing administrative hurdles and optimizing edibility in grant spending.  - Streamlining fund reporting, evaluation and  financial audit processes will allow more time for scientists to focus on research itself.### Doing Science- Evolution in the structure of research teams will require changes in the way young PIs are supported. - Institutes can free up senior scientists’ time for mentoring by reducing administrative work- loads. - Improved training in writing papers and grant applications is needed to help Chinese scientists compete on the global stage. - Expanded training in data management and research project management will increase productivity, efficiency and reproducibility.- Institutes can address human resource deficiencies by doing away with outdated personnel management systems. (bianzhi 编制) - More competitive compensation for contract-based research staff needed to retain talented staff.- By reorienting assessment to focus on research output rather than overseas training experience, institutes can keep more talented scientists in China.- Funders and institutes can promote domestic collaboration by considering more nuanced ways of assessing research to ease the competition for  first authorship. - Chinese policy-makers can facilitate international collaboration by removing administrative barriers to healthy academic exchange.### Sharing Science- Funders and institutes should consider more nuanced and individu- al-focused assessment approaches.- Measures to encourage Open Science in China, in particular the sharing of data, should be considered.- To enhance students’ writing skills, Chinese institutes should consider providing more training in this area — including support for the future generation of scientists. - To address issues with commercial editing services, a global industry-wide accreditation system would help to maintain quality standards.- Chinese institutes can enhance the visibility of their researchers by, for example, creating more accessible English pages on their institutional websites.- Because non-Chinese typically  find Chinese names difficult to pronounce and remember, promotion the Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) in China will be essential.- Chinese institutes and funding bodies could incentivize good science communication by tying it to researcher assessment；- Institutes and funders need to find ways to close the gap between attitude and engagement in science communication;- Media and institutes could maximize their potential for science communication by improving the quality of their science communicators.- More professional and effective science communication outlets are needed## R&D in Singapore Singapore, located at the crossroad between the west and the east, positions itself as the future science and technology hub in Southeast Asia and correspondingly makes a huge investment in driving this vision. In its Research Innovation Enterprise(RIE) 2015 plan (2011-2015 R&D expenditure), S$16.1B(~3.5%GDP)was initiated. ![RIE2015](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/ipython%20notebook/rie-portfolio.jpg) ### Overview of R&D agencies Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council (RIEC)![RIEC](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/ipython%20notebook/research-framework-chartupdated.jpg)Various agencies fit together to create a sustainable value chain spanning from academics to industry. ![spectrum of activities](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18094167/ipython%20notebook/rie-agencies-and-performers.jpg)As a side note, Singapore has a strong presence in semiconductor industry, which offers a great advantage for its mission to become a truly smart city. For example, MediaTek has setup a R&D center in Singapore and plans to invest S$250m by 2020 for IoT R&D. I personally think that many technologies are readily available; those who can connect and integrate various parts of the whole system could have an edge in the IoT era. For more information, please visit [NRF](http://www.nrf.gov.sg/home).
