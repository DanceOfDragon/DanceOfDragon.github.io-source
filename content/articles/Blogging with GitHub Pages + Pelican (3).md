#### Changed THEME again.

Recently I have been exploring various pelican themes.  
**Elegant** met most of my needs and it looks good too. The problem is that I could not get some functions working (e.g. tipue_search, alignment of home page components etc.) Then I switched to **Nuja**, which has a simple and clean home page. However, it is not mobile friendly, could not add the *read more* link to each post. There's barely any documentation for this theme. 

Did not settle. Did keep searching. 

Then I found Dr. Seppe's [website](http://blog.macuyiko.com) and loved it! I found he posted an article about cloud service in China and he is using QQ (a very popular SNS App in the greater China) as well :). I liked the theme so much and I cold-emailed him for  his source code of the theme ( based on **tuxlite-zf** ). Got reply very quickly. It is simply COOL. 

Then I worked through the whole night to customize the theme shared by Dr. Seppe to suit my current needs and my personal taste. Now I am pretty happy with how my blog looks. 

Things I learned: 

- Copying is Okay. Stealing is better. Asking before copying is even better. (well,joking><)
- Learning by doing is the most effective way for me to pick up new skills. I learned a lot through comparing how people customised various themes, crawling though the code to change and test. From my own experience, only what is reproducible is solid, only what is solid is worth my effort.  

Things to do:

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Taste is born, but good taste is earned. (It is out of my focus to develop a website from scratch. Enough to read the code, understand the structure and do customisation. These stuff might be outdated. Good for starting I guess.) This can be considered as a small project (call it：**Notes:HTML/CSS/JS**).
- Keep learning, keep thinking, keep writing, and keep blogging.
