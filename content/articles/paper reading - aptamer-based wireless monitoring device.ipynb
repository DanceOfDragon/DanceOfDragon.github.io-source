The MEDIC device comprises two stacked PDMS channels sandwiched between glass substrates, one of which bears sensing electrodes (working, counter,and reference). The central channel is 40 mm long with a square cross-section of 500 µm × 500 µm. Probes are immobilized on a set of six gold working electrodes (surface area = 0.25 mm2), interdigitated with counter and reference electrodes to form an electrochemical cell. (B to D) The device is fabricated in three phases. Electrodes are patterned on a glass substrate, which is then drilled for vias and bonded to an ozone-treated PDMS sheet bearing the upper channel (B). The lower channel is cut into a PDMS sheet, treated with ozone, and bonded to the base glass substrate (C). The two remaining exposed PDMS surfaces are ozone-treated, aligned, and bonded together (D). Fluidic ports are epoxied to the surface above the vias. The chip is subjected to the probe immobilization protocol and is then ready for use.\n",

    "    In order to clean the gold working electrodes prior to immobilization of the thiolated, MB- modified, cocaine-binding aptamer we performed a series of oxidation and reduction cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4, 0.01 M KCl/0.1 M H2SO4, and 0.05 M H2SO4 (Fig. 2a). The chamber was then immediately filled with 1.0 μM aptamer probe solution. To prepare this solution, a 0.2 mM aptamer in 10 mM Tris solution was first reduced with 5 mM TCEP for 1 hr to cleave disulfide bonds and then diluted to 1.0 μM with phosphate buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, 1.5 M NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) for 1 hr, all at room temperature. After probe immobilization, the chamber was rinsed with DI water and then filled with a freshly-prepared solution of 2 mM 6-mercaptohexanol for 4 hr to passivate the remaining bare electrode area and displace physically adsorbed DNA. The chamber was then rinsed again with DI water and filled with 1× SSC buffer (15 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) prior to measurements. This process yielded highly robust and stable sensors that can operate in blood serum for > 1 hour (Supporting information, Fig S1). Previous work19 suggests that that the stability of C11-based sensors is significantly improved relative to that of C6-based sensors, suggestion that the use of C11-chain aptamer would result in more stable SAMs and longer sensor shelf life in serum.\n",

    "    All flow to the device was controlled via syringe pump (PhD 2000, Harvard Apparatus). The MEDIC input port was connected to an intravenous cannula for animal studies, or multiport valve (Upchurch Scientific) for in vitro studies. The valve was used to select samples bearing different target concentrations. A 3-ml syringe loaded with 1x SSC was placed in a pump and connected to the buffer port on the MEDIC device via a 30-cm length of Tygon (Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics) tubing, with 2.29-mm outer diameter (OD) and 0.76- mm inner diameter (ID). The MEDIC device output port was connected to a primed but otherwise empty 10 ml ‘waste’ syringe placed in a second pump, via 1/16-inch OD and 0.5- mm ID Teflon tubing (Thomson Instrument Company). To monitor flow-rates in real-time, a flow meter (Mitos Flow Rate Sensor, Dolomite Microfluidics) was employed in-line between the output port and syringe pump. The buffer layer was established by engaging the buffer pump at 0.25 ml/h. Simultaneously, sample was continuously drawn into the device by engaging the waste pump at 1 ml/h.\n",

    ">To measure aptamer affinity, a dose-response curve was obtained by subjecting the probe to DOX (Sigma-Aldrich) concentrations ranging from 50 nM to 10 μM in 1× SSC at a flow rate of 1 mL/h. At each concentration, the signal was permitted to equilibrate and then ten subsequent readings were obtained from two separate electrodes and averaged as the reported values. The same procedure was applied for specificity characterization, where DOX was injected at 1 μM while off-target reagents MTC, Ifex, Mesna, DTIC or CDDP (Sigma-Aldrich) were injected at 1 mM concentrations. Kinetic measurements were performed in a reaction-limited regime by flowing target-free buffer at 10 mL/h for 5 minutes to obtain a stable baseline, followed by a 5-minute 1 μM DOX pulse, and then back to buffer. Voltammograms were taken in immediate succession to provide maximal temporal resolution. Dose-response curves were obtained by fitting data to a one-site binding model, and kinetic-response curves were obtained by fitting data to a one-phase association and dissociation model (GraphPad Prism version 5.00C for Mac OS X, GraphPad Software).\n",

To simplify the simulation geometry, we focused on the straight portion of the channel from the junction of the two vertically stacked flows to the outlet region. Based on an expected operational sample-to-buffer throughput ratio of 3:1, the domain depths were assigned to 400 μm and 100 μm, respectively. Input flow-rates were defined at 0.75 and 0.25 ml/h for buffer and sample, respectively, with open pressure defined at the output. Buffer was represented as water, while the blood sample was approximated as water with density increased to 1060 kg/m3 and viscosity increased to 4 mPa·s. A diffusion constant of 1 ×10−9 m2/s was assumed for DOX (19). The diffusivities of HSA, IgG, and fibrinogen—blood protein interferents associated with biofouling—were estimated as 5 ×10−11, 4 ×10−11, and 2 ×10−11 m2/s, respectively (44–46). Analytes were supplied in the sample stream at a concentration of 1 μM at the sample input and convected according to the prior-solved velocity field, and reported concentrations were normalized by this value for the respective species. Solving for the velocity field and then the convection diffusion equation yields the concentration field throughout the channel.\n",
