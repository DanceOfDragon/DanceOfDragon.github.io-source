## PROFILE

> My name is **JIN Lin** (金林 in Chinese). I obtained a B.Eng in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering from National University of Singapore(NUS) on scholarship after I finished my high school in China (High School Affiliated to Southwest University).  I love [reading and writing](http://linnus.net/category/blogenglish.html), [playing with iT stuff](http://linnus.net/category/blogenglish.html). 
> 
> 
> My current focus is on biosensors, in which a few key technologies are (or will) be employed, including microfluidics, self-assembled monolayer (SAM), and electrochemical aptamer sensor. Learning IC for signal conditioning as well.
