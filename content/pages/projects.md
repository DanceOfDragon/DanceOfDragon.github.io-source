### Proj-Tech 2: Data Analyst

Since I have learned a bit Python, it is better to put it in practice through a project. Python is an excellent tool for data processing. Here I focus more on the technical skills/application from a perspective of an engineering professional interested in healthcare industry. That said, essentially, it is the business (including research) insights abridge data and sound decision.There is no easy way. 

Here's a short summary of the requirements for a data analyst position gathered from some websites (e.g. Jobstreets,Indeed) and corresponding textbooks. They might be updated from time to time as I learn more. 

Step by step, move forward.  

**Tech-Business Hybrid Skills** 
>- Industry: knowledge in business processes 
	- healthcare (clinical research, bioinformatics) 
		- Coursera: [Healthcare Informatics & Data Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/medicaltech/30/courses) 
	- chemical(
- Statistics: knowledge in data analysis and modeling, even machine learning. 
	- Basics: mean, median, mode,distribution( standard normal,Poisson,Chi-Square),standard deviation, variance, hypothesis testing, etc. 
	- Design:A/B testing,hypothesis testing, confidence level,Sample size,Power Law;
- Computer skills 
	- Querying language e.g SQL; 
	- Database system: e.g. MySQL,Access,Oracle; Hadoop

		- Python(numpy,pandas,matplotlib,scipy,scikit-learn, ipython)
		- Matlab;
	- Statistical tools,e.g.SAS,SAP;
	- Spreadsheet:Excel，SPSS;
	- Visulization: 
		- Excel(powerpivot),Powerpoint,
		- Javascript/HTML (for online interactive visulization);
- Advanced (Academia-oriented, IT-oriented)

### Proj-Art 0 : *The Story of Art*
It is ridiculously interesting in vestigating(superficially:) )  the ever changing landscape of the arts, including but not limited to paiting, architecture or sculpture. Things sroupt,grow,noursih, withere and gain rebirth from within themselves again and again. Though even the author of the book *The Story of Art* Gombrich could not have the definite confidence in projecting the next mainstream art, it is rather amazing to have an overview of the evolution of the arts. More interesting, accompanied by more readings, arts might even reveal much about the other aspects of the contemporary society. Since its first publish in 1950, Gombrich's book has updated to its 16th version. In the last chapter of the book, he updated his predictions about the arts from time to time. I am going to follow this book (especially the methodology and perspective it employs). First, of course, search in the past.
For each chapter, I extract the illustrations and add a short caption to each one. Noticeably, the book focuses more on western arts. Hopefully, I can take a closer look at all these works someday.

### Proj-Tech 0: **[JIN Lin不扯淡](http://linnus.net)**（Github Pages+Pelican）


	
>A clean,static and distraction free blog created with Github User Page and Pelican. This blog will gradually serve as a centralized site for my online presence, so I will sometimes modify the site to suit for new requirments. The bottom line: clean, simple, as always.`

>[Edit:21July]::changed theme from elegant to Nuja.

>[Edit:23July]::got some issues with Nuja theme, so changed, again,to tuxlie-z.The theme was created by [Alexis Metaireau](https://github.com/ametaireau) and later customised by [Seppe vanden Broucke](http://blog.macuyiko.com). I made some changes to suit my taste and needs based on Dr. Seppe's generous sharing. Great Thanks! This should be final :)
